        <p>Control Sensors Integrated</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Favourite Capstone Memory</h3>
        <p>At the symposium, a few people came up who shared their mobility problem, or those of people around them. I could not help them that day, but it is something I pulled with me into tomorrow.</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Biggest Challenges</h3>
        
            <p>The sensor was quite noisy when moving. A low pass filter was applied, though a balance had to be struck between signal to noise ratio and latency.</p>
        

        <h3 class="subtitle">Takeaways</h3>
        <p>I learned to make time to fail, even when I dont have time. The alternative is to fail 2x.</p>
