  "Qualification": "",

  "Team_Members": "Mohamed Ghaith Majjani",

  "Overall_Capstone_Experience": "Control Sensors Integrated",
  "Favourite_Memory": "At the symposium, a few people came up who shared their mobility problem, or those of people around them. I could not help them that day, but it is something I pulled with me into tomorrow.",
  "Biggest_Challenges": ["The sensor was quite noisy when moving. A low pass filter was applied, though a balance had to be struck between signal to noise ratio and latency."],
  "Takeaway": "I learned to make time to fail, even when I dont have time. The alternative is to fail 2x.",
  "Advice": "Have fun.",
