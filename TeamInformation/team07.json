  "Team_Name": "EyeDentify",
  "Project_Description": "Concussions are a growing concern in sports, and timely, accurate detection is crucial to ensure player safety. EyeDentify introduces a portable concussion assessment tool designed to provide fast, objective evaluations right on the sidelines without the need for medical personnel. Using a VR headset paired with a smartphone, the tool guides athletes through simple eye movement tests to identify potential signs of concussion quickly. By delivering immediate, reliable feedback, EyeDentify enhances player safety and prevents premature return-to-play",
  "Qualification": "Medical AI, Medical Devices, and Sports Specializations & Mechatronics Option",
  "awards": [{"title": "Sustainable Development Design Award", "details": "SYDE & Faculty of Engineering"}],
  "Team_Members": "Nishit Bheda, Humdaan Javed, Hrishik Patel, Isa Mohideen, Divyajeet Zala",
  "Advisor": "Terrence Stewart",
  "Overall_Capstone_Experience": "Fun, Challenging, Memorable",
  "Favourite_Memory": "Late night work sessions with teammates, last minute preparations for presentations, and a lot of messing around in between.",
  "Biggest_Challenges": ["One of the biggest challenges we faced as a team was homing in on the final idea. This took a lot of meetings, lots of scrapped ideas, and doing appropriate feasibility analysis. The key is to not get hung up on an idea, or so attached that one cannot see it’s long term shortcomings. This is a complex stage as we often have a rough idea of how something might be accomplished, but a lot of the smaller details that make or break a project are missing. The key is to recognize the bottlenecks in your project that will affect whether it can be completed in the timeframe of a capstone project. Brutal honesty and self accountability regarding the shortcomings of an idea, and thorough research were some of the ways that our team got through this stage.", "Another challenge we faced was the execution of the project idea. Often, a capstone project has multiple components such as software, hardware, signal processing, AI etc. How a team tackles the urgency of each component, and in which order they are done is of the utmost importance as it will determine how the project progresses. Developing hardware, then signal processing, and then software may be a valid approach for a polished design, but it can be very time consuming within the capstone context. Our team spent a lot of time parallelizing the workflow of each subcomponent through rapid low fidelity prototypes, allowing each team member to make simultaneous progress."],
  "Takeaway": "The biggest takeaway from capstone is that a team should never be afraid of ambitious ideas (given that they’re not infeasible), as this will push each team member to learn a relevant skill that they are bound to find useful in the future. ",
  "Advice": "Future students should be advised to carefully choose their capstone members carefully. This shapes the entirety of one’s capstone experience and is a crucial factor in a team’s success.",
